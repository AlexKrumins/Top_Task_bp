# What the project does
 - Establishes connection to a remote database with proper encryption.
 - Using React, it displays the user's tasks as they are created/retrieved from the database.
 - Employing NPM React-Beautiful-DND, the user can move tasks about the page, from 'favorites' to 'helm' to 'today's tasks' and 'recently completed tasks'
 - Constantly updates the status of tasks, including the elapsed time, via API calls occuring in the background.
 - Through the 'Review Tasks' page, charts are calculated and displayed via data from the user's account.
